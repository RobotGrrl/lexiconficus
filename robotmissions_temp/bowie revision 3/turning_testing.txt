turning testing

1. fwd 255 rev 255
- this is still the best for turning in place on dry sand

2. fwd 255 rev 160
- looks like it puts stress on some of the wheels

3. fwd 160 rev 255
- able to turn a bit easier than #2 but not as good as #1

4. f 255 f 160
- large arc

5. f 255 f 100
- smaller arc
- easier to dig itself into holes

6. f 200 r 200
- "seems" less stress than #1

7. f 160 r 160
- wow! this looks like it works better because the wheels "slide" on the surface of sand while pivoting
- takes much slower though

8. f 180 r 180
- ??? teensy is no longer working

trying to follow this tutorial:
https://www.ctl.io/developers/blog/post/build-a-hacker-news-style-voting-application-with-orchestrate

the express app is created in the index.js file

the keys go in to a .env file so that they won't be committed with source control

heroku uses the .env file for reading the keys

the callback url is what github goes to after the login

adding the passport. snippets to index.js lets it configure passport to use the github strategy. and it sets the callback paths.

to test it out, the server has to be started with
foreman start
not sure what foreman is and currently doesn't work, so will have to look it up later

foreman is the heroku cli. can also just place the keys in index.js and just do node index.js

wait- the .env file is the actual name, and this is what contains the keys

to use them you just do this:
source .env

so it runs the .env file, which is running EXPORT variable name -- and that sets the environment variables. makes sense!

running node index.js, receive this error:

throw new Error('Most middleware (like ' + name + ') is no longer bundled with Express and must be installed separately. Please see https://github.com/senchalabs/connect#middleware.');

don't understand what middleware means. even removing the express. portion doesn't fix it

app.use(logger());
        ^

ReferenceError: logger is not defined

here is info about the middleware:
http://expressjs.com/guide/migrating-4.html#core-changes

so express 4 is different than express 3. now you have to install all these external things.

did npm install on all the new things in index.js that are require()

now there's a new error:

      throw new Error('\'app.router\' is deprecated!\nPlease see the 3.x to 4.x migration guide for details on how to update your app.');
      ^

Error: 'app.router' is deprecated!

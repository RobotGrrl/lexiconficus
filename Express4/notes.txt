trying this tutorial:
http://mherman.org/blog/2015/01/31/local-authentication-with-passport-and-express-4/#.Vl9wV7zsPMU

creating an app from an existing template:
express passport-local-express4

checking if it runs:
node ./bin/www

it works, next step is to install mongodb

keep getting error:
../lib/kerberosgss.c:509:13: warning: implicit declaration of function
      'gss_acquire_cred_impersonate_name' is invalid in C99
      [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]

trying to run:
sudo mongod

but it doesn't work (not found)

trying to install with brew:
brew install mongodb

now when trying to run mongod, get this error:
I STORAGE  [initandlisten] exception in initAndListen: 29 Data directory /data/db not found., terminating
2015-12-02T19:26:14.980-0500 I CONTROL  [initandlisten] dbexit:  rc: 100

there are instructions here:
https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/

mongod needs a directory to write data:
mkdir -p /data/db

or you can just do this:
mongod --dbpath ~/mongodb

added account.js to models directory. for password security, passport-local-mongoose is able to automatically do the salting and hashing of the password for us.

when testing it out:
node ./bin/www

it works, but receive warnings that using an unstable release of mongoose

added the code to index.js within the routes folder

added all of the jade views - jade is a template engine

to see the database do this:
mongo

then this to switch to the right database:
use passport_local_mongoose_express4

then you can do this:
db.accounts.find()

trying this tutorial:
http://mherman.org/blog/2015/01/31/local-authentication-with-passport-and-express-4/#.Vl9wV7zsPMU

creating an app from an existing template:
express passport-local-express4

checking if it runs:
node ./bin/www

it works, next step is to install mongodb

keep getting error:
../lib/kerberosgss.c:509:13: warning: implicit declaration of function
      'gss_acquire_cred_impersonate_name' is invalid in C99
      [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
